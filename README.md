# Population_Density_Calculation
The source file already contains the latitude and longitude of the starting and ending points for each commuting route. Based on the latitude and longitude of their starting points, the home-based population density is obtained; similarly, based on the latitude and longitude of their endpoints, the  work-based population density is obtained. 
Due to the file size limitations for uploads on GitHub, only the first 100,000 records of the source file have been uploaded.
